## Patient Notes
### Bryce
- Works as a **gravedigger**
- Gets an **"Extra Hour"** where time freezes
- Uses the extra hour to catch up on work or *play chess against himself* because it "strengthens and relaxes the mind, all at once". 
	- [ ] When Did this start? What happened to trigger it?**
- Others believe him insane for believing he gets an extra hour
- [ ] Works at **Henley Church**, previously owned by Scientologists who "gave it back for a tax break, or they'd finished doing with it whatever they wanted to do with it".*

    - Has trouble finding help at work
    - Has to use handtools/shovels to dig because of protected relics on site
- Found a **Queen's chess piece "relic"**
	- [ ] Is the piece special?*
	- [ ] Is that when his extra hour started?*
- Athiest, too many religions to pick from
- Believer in the zeitgeist

- Says Dr Dekker was murdered, Dekker unraveled from *lack of control*
- Knows no other info of Dekker's death

### Claire
- Diagnosed *violent paranoia*
- Diagnosed as *delusional*, doesn't believe she is
- What delusions?*
    - "being rich has its perks, but I'd give it all up if it could free me from this madness"
    - [ ] Just the madness of caring for David?*
- **Husband David** estranged
    - Cheated on her with assistant Optometrist
    - *Stabbed David* with a steak knife
        - [ ] Why? Just for cheating?**
    - David is sick, she has trouble coping with caring for him
    - [ ] David's health is declining, he is becoming less responsive, almost comatose, an *"Enigmatic husk"*

### Elin
- Worried about work stress
- Works as nurse in home for the elderly/end-of-life care
- She's "married to [her] work"
- Certified herbalist
- **Prefers herbal remedies** for patients because it can leave them in a clearer state
- [ ] Patients she cares for have a higher rate of death it's "not [her] fault, it just seems to happen that way"**
	- [ ] Do they all seems to pass naturally?**
	- [ ] Patterns in circumstance(s) of death besides her?**
	- [ ] When did this start?*
	- [x] How many have died? Three per month past two months, one this month so far, Hilda may not have long
	- [ ] *Hilda* is "one of the crotchety ones, always swearing or spitting at [her]"
	- [ ] *Hilda* is afraid Elin will "smother her in her sleep"
- Has been seeing Dr Dekker for *nine months*
- Likes Dr Dekker, wasn't "arrogant like most Doctors"


### Marianna
- Marianna seems overtly flirtatious, easily sexually excitable, films "other things" 
- [ ] Marianna feels I'm not listening**
- Wakes up *naked* on the *beach*, *blacks out, slight retrograde amnesia*
    - Blackouts often postcede dancing
    - Doesn't think the dancing causes her blackouts per say, sometimes "**[she] remembers more**"**
    - [ ] Hinted holding her breath may be related to blackouts, like when swimming or anxious**
        - Swims often holding breath, holds her breath when anxious
        - Anxious breath holding, maybe "breathing badly".
    - Got uncomfortable describing possiblity of other things happening prior to blackouts**
        - [ ] What else does she remember prior?
        - [ ] Other locations? Emotions?
- Dr Dekker diagnosed her with generalized anxiety Disroder 
	- [ ] Described it as Breathing Badly? Odd terminology.*
- Dances at The Pearl (Nightclub) 
    - Likes the Pearl because of cheap vodka shots but doesn't drink
    - Likes The Pearl beacuse people seem relaxed, maybe b/c of the cheap vodka 
- Hasn't tried to film her blackouts specifically
    - When asked if she's had anyone watch her prior and during a blackout suggested I do so
- Doesn't know anything about Dr Dekker's murder
- Says Dr Dekker could "really get inside [your head] it's very unsettling, but part of the process, I guess".

### Nathan
- Works as a **shop clerk**
- Feels as if he's in purgatory, "stuck between this day and the next"
- Feels life rarely changes except small things like weather, occassional responses like lack of a nod/acknowledgement
- Truly feels like he's **reliving the same day** like "groundhog's Day", doesn't "move back in time more than a day".
    - "For real change you need tragedy...like a murder"
	    - [x] Why the harsh metaphor? Dr Dekker's murder seemed to cessate his feeling of living on repeat/in purgatory for two weeks
	    - Claims he wouldn't commit murder because "you'd have to keep doing it"
- Feels Dekker was conflicted, no two days were the same for him
	- Why was dekker conflicted? "He had too many optinos like a kid in a sweet shop...I suppose if you take too much time picking all your options run away".
- [x] Suffered a tragic event, was hit by a trolley, killed "Hannah"
	- [x] Who's Hannah? His Fiance and Girlfriend since secondary school
	- [x] Why does he feel it was his fault? Feelings about it were better until working with Dr Dekker, which gave him a sense of Deja Vue, recurring depression
- Describes his days as "a blur...not sure if it's from the sleeping tablets or how [he's] learned to *'switch off'*"*
	- [x] What does switch off mean? How? Suffers from depression, fatigue, and malaise
	- [x] Sleeping Pills? prescribed by Dr Dekker b/c he thought he'd "sleep through to a whole new day"
- [ ] Dekker gave him a pill (*Temazepam*) to prevent his loops with a skull and crossbones on it**
    - Told him to take the pill, thinking it was a placebo
    - [ ] Had another "loop day" the day after taking the pill
        - Maybe ineffective placebo
        - Maybe needs repeat use to be effective
        - Maybe something else

### Jaya
- Who is Ben? One of the night shift cleaners
- Finding the body? 
	- [x] How? Ben found the body in his/my office on Valentine's Night*
	- [x] When? Presumably found late at night, freshly murdered on Valentine's Night
- Why were the police involved?
	- Wanted to interview Jaya she says she was at home alone during the murder window
	- Police report shows no forced entry suggesting someone the Dr knew (patient, Jaya) murdered him either because they let themselves in, or the Dr did
	- Police took his chair
- [x] Did Dr Dekker have enemies? No sometimes patient seesions got heated
- [x] Dr Dekker was stabbed
- [ ] When pressed to name names, "**Susan**, **Annabelle**, **Melissa**, but they're not names of anyone I know".
    - Not patients I've had yet
    - [ ] Who are these people?
    - [ ] Why are they important?

### Lacey
- Neighbor was murdered (throat slit)
- Different neighbor (Agnes) disappeared
	- Thinks a door-to-door saleswoman selling double glazing killed her neighbors
	- Agnes let the saleswoman in
	- Lacey says the saleswoman selling double glazing door to door turned into "a Medusa[...]A woman with snakes for a face" 
	- Dr Dekker didn't believe Lacey's story, or that Agnes was dead
	- Ron (Agnes' husband) only seemed responsive to her murder when the police were there
	- Lacey doesn't suspect Agnes' husband, but did describe him as a "weasley little man[...]who spends far too much time in his garden[...]digging and pruning".
	- Digging, why? What for? Ron was supposedly digging the foundation for a new greenhouse
	- Dr Dekker calls heer the Leech Lady because she "leeches thoughts from people's heads" and "can put them in there, too".
	- On Valentine's night she was at a service at henley Church for single folk**
	- Suggested she is unemployed vs. a double glazing saleswoman, she did not take kindly to this

### Jasmine -- 
- Works at an art gallery called Providence
    - Was working there on Valentine's Nighth until 11pm
    - Bryce was there with her as well
- [ ] Paintings *with people in them* move for her, look at her disapprovingly**
    - [x] In what way are they *looking disapprvingly*? Why? They think Jasmine "doesn't appreciate art because she's too young".
    - [ ] Some paintings Jasmine "can't stop", like a portrait Jasmine's painting of Dorian Gray*
        - Painting of Dorian is split into thirds of a boy, his father, and grandfather to capture the aging process
        - Jasmine describes it as "hideous"
        - It started talking to Jasmine
            - Tells Jasmine she's "ugly, that [she] has no talent, that nothing will become of [her]"
- Asked about Dekker, Jasmine answered that "when [she] told [him] about [her] problem he said [she] should set fire to it".
    - He wasn't specific as to what she should set fire to or what her problem was
    - I think the "problem" is the *painting of Dorian*, but she interpreted it as **Providence itself**
    - After *setting fire to Porvidence* police arrested her, although her boss (**Petra**) didn't press charges. Why didn't Petra press charges?
    	- She doesn't know why Petra didn't press charges
    	- Jasmine said that Petra was losing money on the business, wanted to collect insurance money from Jasmine burning it down, maybe? Jasmine denies this, but Petra could have used it as an excusative event regardless
- Ripped up the painting of Dorian prior to her burning down Providence
    - Says the painting of Dorian haunts her dreams, that "she can see him...hear him screaming". 
    - Dr Dekker prescribed her **Temazepam** to surpress her dreams and help her sleep
