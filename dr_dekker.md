## Patient Notes
### Lacey
#### Session One (Starts in Act Two)
- Neighbor was murdered (throat slit)
- Different neighbor (Agnes) disappeared
	- Thinks a door-to-door saleswoman selling double glazing killed her neighbors
	- Agnes let the saleswoman in
	- Lacey says the saleswoman selling double glazing door to door turned into "a Medusa[...]A woman with snakes for a face" 
	- Dr Dekker didn't believe Lacey's story, or that Agnes was dead
	- Ron (Agnes' husband) only seemed responsive to her murder when the police were there
	- Lacey doesn't suspect Agnes' husband, but did describe him as a "weasley little man[...]who spends far too much time in his garden[...]digging and pruning".
	- Digging, why? What for? Ron was supposedly digging the foundation for a new greenhouse
	- Dr Dekker calls heer the Leech Lady because she "leeches thoughts from people's heads" and "can put them in there, too".
	- On Valentine's night she was at a service at henley Church for single folk**
	- Suggested she is unemployed vs. a double glazing saleswoman, she did not take kindly to this
- - - -
### Jasmine
#### Session One (Starts in Act Two)
- Works at an art gallery called Providence
    - Was **working at Providence** on **Valentine's Night** until **11pm**
    - Bryce was there with her as well
- [ ] Paintings *with people in them* move for her, look at her disapprovingly**
    - [x] In what way are they *looking disapprvingly*? Why? They think Jasmine "doesn't appreciate art because she's too young".
    - [ ] Some paintings Jasmine "can't stop", like a portrait Jasmine's painting of Dorian Gray*
        - Painting of Dorian is split into thirds of a boy, his father, and grandfather to capture the aging process
        - Jasmine describes it as "hideous"
        - It started talking to Jasmine
            - Tells Jasmine she's "ugly, that [she] has no talent, that nothing will become of [her]"
- Asked about Dekker, Jasmine answered that "when [she] told [him] about [her] problem he said [she] should set fire to it".
    - He wasn't specific as to what she should set fire to or what her problem was
    - I think the "problem" is the *painting of Dorian*, but she interpreted it as **Providence itself**
    - After *setting fire to Porvidence* police arrested her, although her boss (**Petra**) didn't press charges. Why didn't Petra press charges?
    	- She doesn't know why Petra didn't press charges
    	- Jasmine said that Petra was losing money on the business, wanted to collect insurance money from Jasmine burning it down, maybe? Jasmine denies this, but Petra could have used it as an excusative event regardless
- Ripped up the painting of Dorian prior to her burning down Providence
    - Says the painting of Dorian haunts her dreams, that "she can see him...hear him screaming". 
	- Dr Dekker prescribed her **Temazepam** to surpress her dreams and help her sleep</p>
- - - -
### Bryce
#### Session One
- Works as a **gravedigger**
- Gets an **"Extra Hour"** where time freezes
- Uses the extra hour to catch up on work or *play chess against himself* because it "strengthens and relaxes the mind, all at once". 
	- [ ] When Did this start? What happened to trigger it?**
- Others believe him insane for believing he gets an extra hour
- [ ] Works at **Henley Church**, previously owned by Scientologists who "gave it back for a tax break, or they'd finished doing with it whatever they wanted to do with it".*
	- [ ] What was the full history of the church?**
    - Has trouble finding help at work
    - Has to use handtools/shovels to dig because of protected relics on site
- Found a **Queen's chess piece "relic"**
	- [ ] Is the piece special?*
	- [ ] Is that when his extra hour started?*
- Athiest, too many religions to pick from
- Believer in the zeitgeist
- Fan of chess, likes the *control* and planning
- Says Dr Dekker was murdered, Dekker unraveled from *lack of control*
- Knows no other info of Dekker's death
#### Session Two
- States he has been "getting a little out of control in [his extra] hour"**
    - [x] How has he been getting out of control? 
        - He said he found a woman (Jessica) in his extra hour he found attractive, so he undressed her and took nude photos of her
        - Bryce said he had stolen some milk from a corner store and "bigger things".
        - Also stole petrol, electricals, etc. to prove to himself he can, "to prove [his] extra hour is actually real". 
        - Denies any murders
- States he took a while to figure out that time was frozen because "he lives on [his] own".
    - Lives alone, occassionally visits his father who lives alone in sheltered housing with dementia
- Asks what I would do with an "extra hour, go to a Fairground"?
    - [ ] Oddly specific line of questioning, why a Fairground? Supposedly "just an example"
    - Initially said I'd use the extra hour to help people, he related a mundane story about helping a woman about to get her purse snatched
    - Confided I may **spy** on people to see what his reponse would be
        - He said he found a woman (Jessica) in his extra hour he found attractive, so he undressed her and took nude photos of her
        - Claims it was Dr Dekker's fault he had this impulse
    	    - Why? How?    
	- Claims Dr Dekker has "changed"
    	- Why? How? Dr Dekker seemed easily distracted during sessions like he "didn't care about his patients anymore" and that "Dr Dekker had given up on the desire to cure [his] mind and for whatever reason wanted to make [him] more unstable".
        - Dr Dekker's advice changed; he told Bryce to "use his imagination to make something up. To think something crazy and it would become real. To think of a way to get more time[...]and it did. But he pushed me. He made me think it".
    - Confided I may **steal** from people to see what his reponse would be
        - Bryce said he had stolen some milk from a corner store and "bigger things".
        - Also stole petrol, electricals, etc. to prove to himself he can, "to prove [his] extra hour is actually real". 
- Patient seems preoccupied, says he "sees a girl standing behind me, possibly a patient that died here, possibly a relative of [mine]". 
- Spent his **Valentine's Day** at the **art gallery** (Providence) as hinted at by Jasmine
- Carried Dr Dekker's casket, claims it wasn't heavy enough to have had a body in it
    - Coffin wasn't empty, thinks there was a decoy in it, maybe a mannequin? 
    - Claims Dr Dekker was either cremated or buried elsewhere because "someone or something didn't want him to be buried [in the ground]".
- Claims to have seen strange things at the graveyard when asked if he's seen people come back from the dead, isn't sure if they'e real or if he just thinks they're real. Didn't elaborate. 
- Didn't stop seeing Dr Dekker out of a sense of hope
### Claire
#### Session One
- Diagnosed *violent paranoia*
- Diagnosed as *delusional*, doesn't believe she is
- What delusions?*
    - "being rich has its perks, but I'd give it all up if it could free me from this madness"
    - [ ] Just the madness of caring for David?*
- **Husband David** estranged
    - Cheated on her with assistant Optometrist
    - *Stabbed David* with a steak knife
        - [ ] Why? Just for cheating?**
    - David is sick, she has trouble coping with caring for him
    - [ ] David's health is declining, he is becoming less responsive, almost comatose, an *"Enigmatic husk"*
#### Session Two
- It's the anniversary of her parents' death today
    - [x] When did they die? 12 years ago
    - [x] How did they die? From CO poisoning, possibly from a faulty boiler

    - [x] Was she close to her parents? Yes, she "loved them very much. They were very good parents".

    - [x] Where was David? She doesn't know, she forgot her key, and the spare was missing, so she didn't check on him.
    - [ ] She still hasn't found the **spare key** *
    - The girl reminded Claire of herself because "she spent a lot of time alone as a child".
    - The girl said she was trying to catch a strange creature she saw in the water
    - Claire hasn't seen any strange creatures, retorted "[they were] minnows probably. Everything's strange when you're a child".
    - The girl lives across the lake, and Claire hasn't seen her before
    - 
- David's skinning skills leave something to be desired. Claire described them as "[still having] lumps of bloody carcass hanging off them".
- On **Valentine's Day** she had a morning (11am) appointment with Dr. Dekker
    - During their session he "made [her] an offer she couldn't refuse", but she'll be "taking it to the grave".
    - Dr Dekker was in a good mood, reports that he "seemed more animated that day. He talked a *lot*"
    - Dr Dekker was more jovial and less sarcastic
    - **Valentine's Night** she was watching David at the Lakehouse
- David's "mental faculties are getting worse" and she wanted to ensure David was okay.
- Does she love David? Even with the cheating? "Yes, I suppose I always will". Seems like a dishonest response if she stabbed him.

    - [x] What was she accused of stealing? The silver locket she's wearing. Says *Alice* (a patient) gave it to her before she died. 
    - [x] *Alice*? Alice was one of her favorites, she "spoke her mind about everything" and "had a wicked sense of humour"
    - [x] By whom? Teri, one of the other nurses, accused her of stealing the locket
    - Teri accused her of being an "HSK" (healthcare serial killer) because "some of her patients have died, and a few of them gave her gifts".

    - [x] How is she getting worse? No specifics, Elin "can just tell" that she's close to dying
    - Specified she needs to see her "before it's too late". 
    - [x] Why her specifically? To help her finish her *unfinished business*.

        - It's how she "help's them move on." 
        - She doesn't think she actually changes it's "like an illusion or something...[her] energy changes."
        - Has to be holding someone's hand for it to work
    - [ ] Why does she want to help her if Hilda is "one of the crotchety ones, always swearing or spitting at [her]"?
- What else has she been given? A watch, ring, china bird; "they're not valuable, just trinkets really."
    - [ ] What do they look like? Seems like Masonic symbolism, maybe not intentional

- Wears an octopus necklace, seems unusual
- [ ] Marianna feels I'm not listening**
- Wakes up *naked* on the *beach*, *blacks out, slight retrograde amnesia*
    - Blackouts often postcede dancing
    - Doesn't think the dancing causes her blackouts per say, sometimes "**[she] remembers more**"**
    - [ ] Hinted holding her breath may be related to blackouts, like when swimming or anxious**
        - Swims often holding breath, holds her breath when anxious
        - Anxious breath holding, maybe "breathing badly".
    - Got uncomfortable describing possiblity of other things happening prior to blackouts**
        - [ ] What else does she remember prior?
        - [ ] Other locations? Emotions?
- Dr Dekker diagnosed her with generalized anxiety Disroder 
	- [ ] Described it as Breathing Badly? Odd terminology.*
- Dances at The Pearl (Nightclub) 
    - Likes the Pearl because of cheap vodka shots but doesn't drink
    - Likes The Pearl beacuse people seem relaxed, maybe b/c of the cheap vodka 
- Hasn't tried to film her blackouts specifically
    - When asked if she's had anyone watch her prior and during a blackout suggested I do so
- Doesn't know anything about Dr Dekker's murder
- Says Dr Dekker could "really get inside [your head] it's very unsettling, but part of the process, I guess".
#### Session Two
- Hasn't had any blackouts since last session 
- Hasn't been to the beach since last session
    - [ ] More about the beach? Why hasn't she been back?
- Described me as "better behaved than Dr Dekker"
    - [x] Why better behaved? Odd description. Dr. Dekker dated his patients. 
	- Dr Dekker dated an older patient named Scarlet
- Marianna and Dr Dekker went out for drinks, ~~presumably on a date~~
- Marianna said she "can be pretty persuasive when she wants to be" suggesting the drinks was her idea

- Wasn't a date, she just noticed Dr Dekker had been "off" and wanted to talk
- She's seen something "truly beautiful. That makes [her] feel dull by comparison."
	- [ ] What was it? A dream of something "beautiful in the sea...Let's wait a while before I tel you my *most intimate secrets*"*
	- [ ] What intimate secrets? 
- Was on the pier **Valentine's Night**, saw Elin and her date (Max) there almost all night
### Nathan
#### Session One
- Works as a **shop clerk**
- Feels as if he's in purgatory, "stuck between this day and the next"
- Feels life rarely changes except small things like weather, occassional responses like lack of a nod/acknowledgement
- Truly feels like he's **reliving the same day** like "groundhog's Day", doesn't "move back in time more than a day".
    - "For real change you need tragedy...like a murder"
	    - [x] Why the harsh metaphor? Dr Dekker's murder seemed to cessate his feeling of living on repeat/in purgatory for two weeks
	    - Claims he wouldn't commit murder because "you'd have to keep doing it"
- Feels Dekker was conflicted, no two days were the same for him
	- Why was Dekker conflicted? "He had too many optinos like a kid in a sweet shop...I suppose if you take too much time picking all your options run away".
- [x] Suffered a tragic event, was hit by a trolley, killed "Hannah"
	- [x] Who's Hannah? His Fiance and Girlfriend since secondary school
	- [x] Why does he feel it was his fault? Feelings about it were better until working with Dr Dekker, which gave him a sense of Deja Vue, recurring depression
- Describes his days as "a blur...not sure if it's from the sleeping tablets or how [he's] learned to *'switch off'*"*
	- [x] What does switch off mean? How? Suffers from depression, fatigue, and malaise
	- [x] Sleeping Pills? prescribed by Dr Dekker b/c he thought he'd "sleep through to a whole new day"

#### Loop Days
- [ ] Dekker gave him a pill (*Temazepam*) to prevent his loops with a skull and crossbones on it**
    - Told him to take the pill, thinking it was a placebo
    - [ ] Had another "loop day" the day after taking the pill
        - Maybe ineffective placebo
        - Maybe needs repeat use to be effective
        - Maybe something else
- - - -
### Jaya
#### Session One
- Who is Ben? One of the night shift cleaners
- Finding the body?

	- [x] When? Presumably found late at night, freshly murdered on Valentine's Night
- Why were the police involved?
	- Wanted to interview Jaya she says she was at home alone during the murder window
	- Police report shows no forced entry suggesting someone the Dr knew (patient, Jaya) murdered him either because they let themselves in, or the Dr did

- [x] Did Dr Dekker have enemies? No sometimes patient seesions got heated
- [x] Dr Dekker was stabbed

	- Opted to hire a solicitor to handle the situation
	- Ben's mum was cuddling him, apparently

	- Grief?
	- Numbness?
- Dr Dekker talked about patients with Jaya. Ethical breach, but could give me useful information
	- Lacey? No answer
	- Jasmine? No answer
	- Bryce? Jaya feels he has a lot of "misdirected anger...he stares at me as if he's undressing me with eyes. He's not the first person that's done that, but it feels worse coming from him."
		- Corroborates his mysoginistic view of women expressed by undressing and taking photos of his neighbor in his extra hour
	- Claire? "Claire seems to be shaken by something I offer her drinks every time she comes in, but she always refuses them. [It's like] she wants to finish her session, then run off and do something else."
		- Could be preoccupied about her husband, could be something else
	- Elin? Described her as a "lovely person" and "not sure why she's here."
	- Marianna? Says she's a "special girl[...]something about her just makes you want to follow her."
	- Nathan? Describes him as "a mess...never talks to me much, and he's always in the same clothes." He reminds her of *Tom*.

	- Jaya has his **resignation letter**
	- Dr Alderby oversees hiring and firing? He's a trsutee and acts as a patienbt to test new doctors
- Jaya oversees the practice as a sort of manager, headhunted myself and Dr Dekker, recommended them to the board of trustees
- Jaya and Dr Dekker had late night conversations often
	- He seemed preoccupied with finding patterns in patients
	- What kind of patterns? Common experiences patients may have had, patients seemed similar, maybe drawn to him
- Claire and Elin had appointments on **Valentine's** and 11am and 3pm respectively
- Dr Dekker did phone and ask for Nathan's number, which seemed "a bit strange"

## Evidence and Exegesis
### Alderby Session Videos
- 
### Dekker's Resignation Letter
### Reference Letters

## Murder Theories and Evidence
### Lacey
- No evidence yet
### Jasmine
- No evidence yet
### Bryce
- Spent his **Valentine's Night** at the **art gallery** (Providence) as hinted at by Jasmine
- Could have ample time to murder Dr Dekker using his extra hour, however, that would fit outside anyone else's perception
- Denies having committed any murders, but has loose morals given his theft and voyeurism
- Doesn't hold much ill will towards Dr Dekker, maybe slight resentment in the way he described Dekker "making him think certain things" but "didn't stop seeing Dr Dekker out of a sense of hope"
### Claire
- Does have the ability given she's stabbed her husband, suffers from violent, paranoid delusions
- Doesn't seem to have motive or propensity, however, except that during their session he "made [her] an offer she couldn't refuse", but she'll be "taking it to the grave".
	- So could've been an assisted suicide instead of murder, which may explain Dr Dekker's change in personality as suicidal individuals often express peace and joviality once they've decided to end it for good
	- Alibi of watching David that night can't exactly be corroborated by anyone else
### Elin
- No real supporting evidence yet of her as the murder, unless the theory of her killing patients develops
- Maybe her using her gift (changing into patients' loved ones) hastens their death? Although she doesn't/wouldn't seem to know that directly
### Mariana
- No supporting evidence for her as a suspect yet
- Was on the pier **Valentine's Night**, saw Elin and her date (Max) there almost all night
### Nathan
- "For real change you need tragedy...like a murder"
	- [x] Why the harsh metaphor? Dr Dekker's murder seemed to cessate his feeling of living on repeat/in purgatory for two weeks
	- Claims he wouldn't commit murder because "you'd have to keep doing it"
- His belief that Dekker's murder got him out of his loop days seems to suggest he may have had other catalytic events that broke his loop days for shorter periods, leading him to commit murder to lengthen his break from them
- Dr Dekker had phoned Jaya for Nathan's number the day he was murdered. Odd. 
### Jaya
- No evidence yet
